# NetworkFlows
python Implementation of maximum flow algorithm from Network flows book by Ahuja, Magnanti, Orlin.

Specifically, three algorithms namely Preflow-push, Capacity Scaling and Shortest Path augmenting for maximum-flow problem are implemented.

- Network.py contains the data structure to represent the network

- algorithms.py contains the three algorithms

- run_script.py contains the random generation of networks
